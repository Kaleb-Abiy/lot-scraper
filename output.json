      "lot_title": "<p>1995 HKS T-002 / BCNR33 Record Breaker</p>",
      "lot_description": "<p>HKS is the leading auto tuning company in Japan. Their passion, skill and achievements with the second-generation Skyline GT-R, is second to none. Nobody will argue with this fact. Racing with the BNR32 GT-R, they appeared in the JTC (Japan Touringcar Championship/Group A) from 1992. Engines of most cars were maintained by factory-backed staffs but HKS was the only company with their own maintenance crew. In 1993, even though racing as a privateer, they won pole position twice. Winning 3rd race at Sugao in 1993, as “developing a BNR32 that can beat European tuned complete cars such as RUF and Alpina” as their concept, they suped up the RB26DETT up to 2688cc. Taking balance in to consideration, they moved up the fuel tank behind the rear seat.  They unveiled the 2-seater “ZERO-R”. Developing an aero-dynamically superior special body, and repeating tests at Autobahn and Nürburgring, they built a complete BNR32 that can “easily break 300km/h”. The “second-generation GT-R tuning specialist” HKS developed this Record Breaker “T-002” in 1995. Their concept: “The fastest BCNR33 .” The first target for the Record Breaker was to break the lap record of 1 minute at the Tsukuba Circuit 2000. The spec of the machine that achieved this record: A set of two 2.7-liter/719ps/81kgm HKS GT2530 turbine. Breaking the fastest lap time at Tsukuba Circuit, the second target for T-002 was the fastest 0 to 300km/h acceleration time at JARI which was at that time Yatabe High Speed Course in Ibaraki. They updated the car from the fastest-circuit-model to a maximum-speed model. Although encountering various troubles, at the end of 1996, (as Daijiro Inada as the driver), they clocked “17.64 seconds” breaking what was their goal of 20 seconds by a wide margin. On January 1995, a car was delivered, chassis number “BCNR33-001275” as its basis. From then until June, in 6 months they finished the initial phase of development. In winter, when the temperature dropped, and it became easier to record a good time, the time attack was performed. At the end of 1995, with Shuji Matsuda driving, they recorded at that time an unbelievable 58.715 seconds. Not only the GT-R tuners in Japan but those globally were shocked by this accomplishment. By achieving this great record, they solidified their status as “GT-Rs HKS.”  The spec of the machine that achieved this record: A set of two 2.7-liter 920ps/84kgm HKS GT3037 turbine. The car put up for auction is the actual T-002 that broke the fastest time twice, but it was completely restored and updated to be exhibited at the 2019 Tokyo Auto Salon/HKS booth. The exterior and interior were both updated and the engine was replaced with a RB26DETT, which had been kept in stock condition. The engine used to break the fastest time, was almost gone on the first try so it has been replaced with a normal engine. Many HKS quality tuning parts such as the GTIII 5R turbine, etc. are used in this car. It is a complete “show car” but if the winning bidder would rather have the engine tuned to replicate the “Tsukuba 58” spec” it could be done with additional cost. This is a very rare chance to get your hands on and re-design the record breaking “fastest Record Breaker” to your own liking.</p>",

      "lot_title": "<p>1975 Lancia Stratos Stradale/Gr.4 Conversion</p>",
      "lot_description": "<p>Lancia Stratos is a commercially available sports car that was devolved and produced as a Group 4 machine capable of entering the WRC (World Rally Championship). Stratos was originally a name for a design study of a midship car created with components of the Lancia Fulvia HF that was displayed at the Torino Show in 1970. Cesare Fiorio, of Lancia Corse was looking for an alternative one-off rally machine to the Fulvia that was struggling against the Alpine A110 and saw potential in this vehicle. Convincing both Lancia and Bertone to help realize his plan, an unheard of project was hatched to create a rally-exclusive car. The drivers and developers both coveted a car under 1000kg, engine output more than 300hp, 2 seater, mid engine, light-weight body with reinforced plastic, and the shortest wheel base possible, which was a unheard concept at that time. Prominent technicians such as,  Marcello Gandini, Gianni Totti, Nicola Materazzi, Mike Parkes, Gian Paolo Dallara were assembled to make this happen. By 1971, at the Torino Show, Stratos HF Prototype was already announced. With the engine, Lancia’s CEO Pierugo Gobbato asked Giovanni Carlo Francesco Agnelli and Enzo Ferrari for help. They produced 500 Ferrari Dino V6 units, enough for the homologation of the Group 4 and in November of 1972, they made their debut in the Le Tour de Corse. When the  production finally started and the regulation to qualify for the Group 4 homologation was  relaxed to 400 cars, they managed to attain works team status for the WRC right before the start of the season. Winning race after race, their success was described as the “Stratos theatre”. Winning the WRC title three years in a row from 1974, 75 and 76. But starting 1977, due to the parent company’s decision, the scope of its activity was downsized. The WRC in 1978 proved to be the last race that the Stratos raced as a works team. The car put up for auction is a Torino Stradare  (chassis number: 829ARO 001923(#1923)) registered under Lancia S.p.A. The car’s original license plate was M 38442 TO. The car changed ownership from Lancia to a dealership in Torino, Salone Auto rivoli.  It was then bought by a private owner. The founding owner of an apparel brand “Cristiano Fissore”, bought the #1923 on April 1987. The University Motors which races in Genoa, converted the car using parts from the Stratos special shop into a Group 4 Competizione car. In 2003, the #1923 was sold to a Stratos special shop, Autohaus Sparwald, based in Ensdorf, Germany which also operated as a dealership for FIAT and Lancia. They did major maintenance to the engine peripherals and due to requests from the owner-to-be Englishman, Robert Whitehouse, the body color was changed from its original blue to the Alitalia-look. Whitehouse took the #1923 to England and to enter historic rallies, attained FIA HTP papers from the English MSA(current Motosport UK) and raced in a few events. The #1923 was imported to Japan around 2006 and the body was refined to match the 1976-version works car. It is in excellent condition. The #1923 comes with a manufacturer’s certificate and it states that the engine number (829ARO) matches that of the chassis.</p>",

      "lot_description": "<p>Way after sports cars and Formula cars, touring car races began to race under FIA regulation “Group 2” in 1963. At the same time ETC (Europe Touring Car Challenge) started and various car makers began to participate in this category. The Italian giant, Alfa Romeo produced homologation in 1964 for this 4-door saloon, Giuria Super TI. The famous privateer, Jolly Club, was in charge of ETC but could not compete with the light weight and powerful Ford Cortina Lotus which raced in the 1.6-liter class. Autodelta which is the competition division, developed the 2-door coupe, Giulia Sprint GT-based, exclusive model. In 1965, the Giulia Sprint GTA was unveiled. As the A for GTA stands for Alleggerita (=light-weight), roof, both doors, engine hood, front/back fender, steel trunk lid were replaced by the 7-10% magnesium-including thin aluminum alloy called “Perelman 25”. While the normal version weighs 950kg, it was reduced to approximately 820kg. The cylinder head of the R-alminium straight 1570cc 4DOHC unit was made into a twin plug, enhancing the compression ratio to 9.7, equipping it with a Weber 45DOOE carburetor, it managed to exceed the standard 106hp at 115hp/6000rpm. It was sold for 2.99 million 5000 Lira. Of the Giulia Sprint GTAs, the most special ones are the pure racing-version Corsa which only 50 were produced. Both the body’s outer panel and floor are made of aluminum which reduced the weight to 745kg. Also, Autodelta tuned the engine up to 170hp, equipped it with a 5-speed gear box and ZFs LSD. GTA Corsa began works activity with the help of Autodelta and showed excellent performance from 1966 to 1969, winning the ETC 1.6-liter class 4-years in a row. The car put up for auction is the Giulia Sprint GTA Corsa (chassis number: 613705) was produced on September 28th, 1965. The body color remains in the original rosso (red) with Alfa Romeo’s manufacture certificate stating it was delivered to France on October 22nd. Details are not available but as with other GTAs this 613705 also raced in France. For the back part of the differential, to prevent the rear suspension from rolling, rare racing parts such as Autodelta’s slide anchor CRBB are used. Only 501 Giulia Sprint GTA are said to be produced. The Corsa, which only 50 of them were produced, is a must-have collector’s item for Alfistas.</p>",

It is a FIA GT3 machine, positioning itself between LM-GTE factory backed 911GT3RSR and the Porsche Carrera Cup used 911GT3Cup. The body is eye-catching for its aero equipment, such as the large rear wing. The body length is 4604mm, front full width is 1975mm, and rear full width is 2002mm. The car is double the size of other cars. The wheelbase is 2463mm longer than the 997GT3R. The race department’s first request was a longer wheelbase when 911 changed to 997 from 991. This resulted in an improvement of the weight balance and the quality of aerodynamic performance. Also, the handling improved during high speed driving. Due to the roof, front lid, fender, wheel arch, door, side session, rear end session, and rear all  being made of CFEP and all of the windows being made of polycarbonate, even though the size increased, the vehicle weight remained same as the predecessor at 1220kg. The 4-liter water-cooled horizontally-opposed cylinder straight-six direct injection engine attached to the rear with a direct fuel injection at a maximum 200 bar and variable valve timing mechanism made effective combustion possible. Maximum output is 500ps and also fuel efficiency and durability had improved. Also, electronic devices such as, constant mesh sequential 6-speed transmission which has a paddle shift, mechanical LSD, ABS, traction control came standard with this car. The car put up for auction is 2016 model and 38 of them were delivered. Naoya Yamano, Jörg Bergmeister, Tim Bergmeister, and Yuya Sakamoto drove the car at the SUPER GT and GT300. Entering as the semi-factory based team Excellence Porsche team KTR, the car finished 2nd and 3rd at the AUTOPOLIS Alternative. The next day, they finished 5th in the finals and 10th for the team ranking. After that, GT3R placed seventh for race 1 and race 2 in Blancpain GT Asia Series at Fuji Speedway in 2017. By 2018 season, an updated 911GT3 R Evo-Kit 2018 entered the Blancpain GT Asia Suzuka Round. They finished 10th and 18th for Race 1 and Race 2 respectively.

      "lot_description": "<p>The Porsche 935K is built by the German Porsche tuner, Kremer Racing, according to Group 5 regulation. Inside the body,  it is what you may call a evolved-version of the works machine 935/77. At the 24 Hours of Le Man, racing among prototype racing cars, the 935K3 racing for Kremer won the overall title in 1979. The car continued to show its high potential in various races after that. The Porsche 935 was originally developed for the World Championship for Makes, which began in hopes of boosting the staggering popularity of sports car racing. The race was for Group 5 cars: Cars that were more similar to commercially available cars. If it cleared the minimum amount of production number (400), and retained the approved vehicle image (including engine storage area, driving method) , most altercations were allowed. For this, the Group 5 was called the “Silhouette Formula”. The Porsche developed the speciality model 935 based on the 930 Turbo. Although the monocoque shell is the same as those of commercially available models, the front was changed to a steel tube space frame, titanium springs, 917 ventilated disc break, a 2856cc flat-six single turbo capable of 590hp, and aerodynamically superior FRP-made flat-nose body were applied. Studying the regulation meticulously, and after careful preparation the 935 overpowered its rivals since its debut. As the vehicle was sold to privateers starting 1977, the scene at the World Championship of Makes was so much so that people were calling the race “a one make race for 935”. The Kremer Racing, led by the Kremer brothers who had a Porsche tuning shop in Colgne, Germany showed they can put up a fight with the factory-backed teams. From the start of the 1976 series, the brothers raced with original machines like the 935K1 and 935K2, an altered version of 911RSR. For the 1979 season, they developed the 935K3, based on the factory-backed car 935/77. The exterior did resemble the 935/77 but with the aluminum roll cage extended to the pivot of the front/rear suspension and with a strengthened body, the gear box attached upside down realizing a low center of gravity, equipped with a 3165cc flat-six twin turbo (2943cc for Le Man) complete with an air-cooled single inter-cooler that generates more than 800hp, it was a more advanced version. With this 935K3, the brothers raced the 24 Hours of Le Man, World Champions of Makes, Germany’s National Championship as a factory-backed team. They also started selling the cars to customers. The success of  updating the existing 935 and 930 turbo 953K3 specs, led to the increase of 953K3 on the market. This 935K3/80 put up for auction is exactly that. In 1977, it was delivered as a 930 turbo with a VIN number of 9307700486 (Original owners manual available). The car was brought in to Kremer around 1981 and various altercations were applied to the 935K3/80 including a large  rear flap. The car is equipped with a 3-liter Le Man-type engine. No major races on record, but in 1981 and 1982, the car entered the ADAC Auto Cross, and a log book of the records the car raced in is available. Because the car had until recently been racing in international classic races such as the Le Man Classic, FIA HTP papers for this car are available, too. The car is race ready and ready to enter various races. Due to the recent popularity of the Group 5, many races are springing up especially in Europe. For this reason, the popularity of the car should rise.</p>",

      "lot_description": "<p>In 1994, All Japan Touring Car Championship was transferred from the JTCC, which four-door factory production cars race to the JTC, which Group A machines race, after FIA modified the rules. Before the changes happened in Japan, in Europe, after England Touring Car Championship (BTCC) had the transition period, it became Super Touring Race and the popularity had exploded. On the other hand, Germany Touring Car Championship (DTM) proceeded its own path evolving as a Group A machine. Adding Alfa Romeo from the Italian Touring Car Championship,  they developed into the International Touring Car Championship (ITC). Super Touring Cup(STC) was hosted by ADAC as the Domestic Championship in Germany. Super Touring started to come to the fore in Nuer, Spa, and 24 Hours Race, as BMW showed its overwhelming strength. They raced with a factory backed team at the BTCC, monopolizing the driver title and team title from 1992 to 1995. Even in JTCC, the factory backed Schnitzer team entered the series with 318i and won the championship. Laugharia/Duetz/Bug Taylor team, Bigazzi won the 24 Hours Nürburgring as a semi-works system. 320ST also got the overall win in Spa 24 Hours with a BMW factory backed team and FINA BASTOS team in 1996 and 1997. The car won three 24 Hours Races and this Super Touring Machine does not have any major crash on record. The color remains the same since the 24 Hours Race in 1997. The drivers' name, Radigues/Duez/Hellary are still on the side window. BMW motor sports Inc. which does not exist as an organization, built the E36 touring car's engine and its related parts from the white body are still in a good condition. The car is still in circuit running condition. The BMW Super Touring Machine level of completion is still high at today's standard and has an overwhelming presence. A lot of spare parts come with the car.</p>",

The engine also is the same 3799cc V8 twin turbo, but the maximum output was detuned to 500ps considering the overall body balance and the best performance capable. The gear box was changed to Ricardo’s 6-speed paddle shift sequential which is 80kg lighter than a road car. Aerodynamic division of McLaren F1 is responsible for the rear wing installation, diffuser, wide fender, etc., everything other than the door and roof is improved. A radiator was added thus improving the cooling system, and Akebono brake's disc and rotor and Bosch's ABS were also added. Only 20 vehicles were delivered from 2012 with 13 customer teams entering races across the world. The car became a success winning 19 championships. This example, chassis number MP4-12C-GT3-026 with a homologation number of GT3-31, entered the GT Asia at the Fuji Speedway on July 18th and 19th, as a joint team of BINGO RACING and K’s Frontier. Akira Iida and Taiyo Iida came in 15th place in the 5th race and placed 15th in the 6th race. The car participated in the Super Car Race Series in 2016 as K’s Frontier. In that race, Taiyo Iida took 1st place in the 1st race and finished second for the 2nd race. Unfortunately, the car cannot acquire a license plate for the public road, but is still in race-ready condition. Documents of homologation and parts are available.

      "lot_description": "<p>Making its debut in 2010, the BMW Z4 GT3 is a FIA GT3 approved pure racing machine. GT3 is a sports car category founded in 2005. To qualify for this category, the car had to be either a two-seater, or 2+2 coupe-based machine and 200 of these car had to be produced commercially for twelve-months straight. A lot of wiggle room exists in terms of alteration allowed to the car. If it is from the manufacturer, even the engine and its drive system can be changed. But to have an even playing field regarding the performance, the fine points of the regulation are different depending on car types. BMW Motor Sports developed this BMW Z4 GT3 to take its place of the M3 GT/GT2, as E89 type Z4 as its base model. Equipped with aero parts that create an huge downforce, such as the huge front spoiler, rear wing, wide fender and the large diffuser, the overall size is larger compared to the cars on the market with a total length of 4387mm, width of 2010mm, height of 1210mm and wheelbase of 2510mm. The drive system is still FR but the engine for this car is M3’s 4.4-liter V8 NA unit. The 408ECU computer, equipped with the Power 400 control unit, with a maximum output of 515ps, all the know-how collected from M3 GT2 are applied to this car. The gear box is a 6-speed sequential transmission. Also, the suspension, ABS, ESP, and traction control were all customized for the GT3. The chassis was updated and sold for approximately 39.5 million yen (1 euro=¥142). Z4 GT3 is approved by GT3 regulations such as FIA GT3 European Championship, International GT Open, ADAC GT Masters, and also raced in the Japanese SUPER GT series. One of these cars is put up for auction. It  is the TWS LM corsa BMW Z4. This TWS LM Corsa, in cooperation with INGINE in 2014, raced in the GT300 class, driven by Akira Iida and Taiki Yoshimoto (In Rd.6, 8 Shinya Sato joined the team). Though it was the first year for them, by the fifth race, at the Fuji 300km, they finished 5th, and  in their 7th race Buriram United International Circuit (Thailand) they finished 4th, and the 6th race in the Suzuka 1000km, after a fierce battle with the ARTA CR-Z GT they won the race. Their team ranking was 5th, and the drivers ranking for Yoshimoto was 6th, and Iida 7th. The coloring from those days have been removed but, maintained at a ready-to-race condition, so it can be taken to the circuit right away to race. In case the historic GT3 race begins in the near future, laying hands on a vehicle in excellent condition and firepower might be a good decision.</p>",

      "lot_description": "<p>The LM07 Toyota is a Group C machine produced by the Japanese Le Man Garage in 1987. The Group C machine not being popular among the casual fans, we need to delve into the background of how this machine came to birth. In 1982, the Group C was founded, and that October at Fuji Speedway, WEC Japan was held. It had been a while since a world championship was held in Japan so among Japanese constructers, the mood to create a domestic group C machine was high. Among them was Le Man Commercial Group’s contractor division, Le Man Garage, which imported and sold racing cars and parts. The LM03C debuted on July 1983 at the Fuji 1000km with Haruto Yanagida/Koji Tomioka as drivers. The LM-03 was developed as the third car they developed following the Thunder LM-39 which raced both GC and F2 and the Skyline Turbo C which was developed for the  Kyalami 9 Hour Race in 1982. The side radiator of this Group C machine shows major influence from the Porche 956 and the chassis combines the single skin aluminum twin tube monocoque with rear steel tube sub frame. The car is equipped with a Nissan LZ20B-type 2089cc straight-4 turbo, thus the car entered as the Fairlady Z/C. But due to lack of rigidity of the chassis and lack of engine power and maturation, the car struggled. Next year in 1984, improvements were made and 3 cars were introduced as the LM04C. The cars were distributed to Central 20 racing led by Yanada and Hasemi Motor Sports led by Masahiro Hasemi, with Hasemi/Kenji Tohira finishing 4th at the All Japan Fuji 1000km. In 1985, the Le Man Garage developed a LM05C that passed the safety guidelines introduced that year. The basic concept follows that of the LM03C and 04C but  the monocoque of the footboy, etc. were upgraded  to fit the safety standards, and the aluminum honey comb applied to improve the rigidity. Also the body design was revamped with the Venturi-structured under floor and the hollow, called the Porsche hump, was moved to the front to improve the aerodynamics. On the other hand, the LM05C is fitted with a 2341cc Nissan FJ23 inline-four, four-valve turbo engine. On the right side of the body, a radiator and oil cooler , on the left side an inter cooler was mounted. The LM05C (At the time, called Nissan Turbo C) debuted from Team Le Man at Fuji 500 mile in July, and in the rain at the WEC Japan the trio of Osamu Chugo/Akio Morimoto/Piro Emanuel started from the 23rd grid and finished second to everybody’s surprise after Kazuyoshi Hoshino’s March 85C Nissan, the first Japanese driver and Japanese car to win the WEC. Next year in 1986,  with Nissan providing the powerful VG30-type 3-liter V6 turbo, Le Man decided to change the chassis to March but in order to utilize the good balance that the LM05C had with the smaller-output engine, they created the LM06C with a 2090cc Toyota 4T-GT inline-4 turbo. With CARA as their sponsor, the duo of Akio Morimoto/Frantz Conrad raced in the All Japan Endurance Championship and WEC In Japan, but unfortunately the 10th place finish at the All Japan Fuji 500km was their best finish. The LM07 Toyota is the LM06C with a Toyota 2140cc inline-4 3S-G turbo. The chassis and body has basically not changed from the LM05C but with OLIO FIAT as a sponsor, Osamu Nakako/Maurizio Sandro Sala pair performed well in this car, such as 7th place finish in the opening race at the All Japan Fuji 1000km. They also finished 10th at the Fuji 500 mile race and 7th in the International Suzuka 1000km. The car put up for auction is the only LM07 Toyota built in 1987, which Japanese specialist restored to running condition. Due to its recent restoration, a shake down and setup of the individual parts are still required.</p>",

      "lot_description": "<p>In August of 1968, Nissan Motor announced a new model for the first time since the merger with Prince Motor. It was the third generation Skyline (type C10). That October, at the Tokyo Motor Show, “Skyline GT Racing-type” was released as a reference exhibit. This car is equipped with a 2-liter straight-six DOHC “S20” which is a detuned GR8-type engine for the race-machine R380. In February, 1969, the commercial version Skyline GT-R (PGC10) was released. At the JAF Grand Prix held in May, the four works machine built at the Nissan Murayama Factory made their debut. The C10 won this race due to the disqualification of the Toyota 1600GT. The car showed unmatched power in the races that followed, beating the rivals by a wide margin and winning consecutive races. When the 2-door hard top was added to the Skyline in 1970, the GT-R also added a 2-door KPGC10. Compared to the 4-door type, the wheel base was shorter by 70mm and lighter by 20kg. This improved its dynamic performance. At the same time, the race models also showed improvements. Equipped with a Lucas fuel injection, it realized the dry sump of the 1989cc straight-six DOHC unit. It is said to have reached 264ps/8400rpm, 21.0kg-m/6800rpm. On January, 1972 at the Fuji 300km Speed Race Super Touring Race, Kunimitsu Takahashi won his 50th GT-R race. When his career was finally over, he had won 57 races domestically and was responsible of “the Legend of GT-R” that is still alive today. But as Mazda introduced the compact yet powerful Mazda Savanna, the GTR started to struggle due to its large body-size with a massive frontal projected area, the engine itself weighing 200kg, and a total weight of 1020kg. Still at the latter half of 1972, minor modifications such as changes from front solid disc & rear drum to front ventilated disc & rear solid disc were applied to try to change its fate only to see the factory-backed team dismantled after the Fuji Masters 250km Super Touring Champion Race. The private teams that succeeded the factory-back predecessor also disappeared from the big races by the end of 1973 season. The car put up for auction, was created by Nissan Prince Sports Corner which used to exist in Omori, Tokyo. The Nissan owned company assembled this KPGC10 racing model in 1972. The owner, who later on opened GTR Service Watanabe in Imari City, Saga Prefecture, is Shigeru Watanabe who is revered as the “God of GT-R”. Because he was so much in love with the GT-R, he quit his day job and for some time worked on his mechanical skills at Sports Corner. Originally white, Mr. Watanabe replicated the racing color of that time. This KPGC10 has raced in a few races. No major  races could be identified but in May, 1975 it finished 12th at the Chugoku Kyushu District Atsu Grand 200 Race, August the same year, it finished 10th in the Mastery Silver Cup Race, and in November, 1976, teaming up with Seiji Nambu it finished 7th in the 1976 West Japan 500km Race. One fact that stands out is that this KPGC10 is a one-owner-car; It has been with Mr. Watanabe the whole time. Naturally, being a race car, the car has gone through modifications by Mr. Watanabe’s own hands. Considering that not many cars remain from that era that were delivered with a race car specifications, it is unbelievable that a car that kept this much of its original flavor and it is still in a race ready condition. For this reason also, this KPGC10 has a special place in Japanese Racing History and Skyline History.</p>",
